That seems like a pretty basic time query but with an unusual capitalization that might indicate either urgency or just casual emphasis.\n\nOkay, first things first - they probably want to know the current local time rather than any specific timezone since they didn't specify one. The lack of details suggests this is for immediate use, maybe checking schedules or appointments.\n\nI should respond in a friendly but direct manner matching their tone slightly while keeping it professional. The all-caps might be shouting, so I'll acknowledge that with capitalization in my response too to mirror their style without being overly intense.\n\nThe user didn't provide location information though... If they wanted precise time they'd have specified timezone or city earlier.

You may want to consider the trade-offs between these approaches in terms of performance, complexity, and compatibility with different clients.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,473,221,221,221,221,61297,20076,23893,6969,17485,7354,53569,13953,2006,362,4823,3680,25874,5257,362,26487,77273,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,4599,11850,3361,5885,304,264,4823,2077,311,264,26487,5446,11,1070,527,3892,20414,499,649,1935,1473,16,13,3146,3222,30430,96618,1472,649,5665,16559,279,3361,5885,1701,279,1595,98783,55358,734,304,13210,477,555,7999,62500,63,8272,555,279,70822,13340,315,1855,3752,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1040,3361,4873,284,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,368,1025,1040,21136,4873,284,57837,1161,3037,4873,317,14196,19884,17,13,3146,5483,10258,449,5911,9779,96618,1472,649,1005,279,1595,5483,10258,55358,1749,449,264,2587,5911,9779,734,430,41800,3361,5885,449,872,28883,11028,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1723,8454,20989,33616,6922,8,341,220,471,4823,10258,6922,11,320,798,11,907,8,591,341,262,422,320,970,21326,16428,3874,341,415,907,284,67076,489,907,280,262,457,262,471,907,280,220,1657,633,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,284,8454,20989,33616,2657,317,14196,19884,18,13,3146,16834,264,6875,477,12914,96618,4427,20797,323,49125,11,1778,439,3676,477,29678,11,3493,5918,3502,5528,369,11850,3361,5885,304,4823,14847,382,13617,320,15143,997,74694,14402,198,475,314,84266,335,505,364,3007,66589,2412,322,5585,1040,2077,284,341,220,2704,25,220,1049,345,220,828,25,341,262,836,25,364,13379,50728,756,262,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,368,1270,220,457,2368,1040,3024,284,84266,5802,317,14196,19884,19,13,3146,5483,47,320,5483,449,23889,33395,25,1442,279,3016,374,3339,264,1715,311,264,2204,6371,11,499,649,1005,4823,47,311,3790,3361,5885,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1723,3790,5122,79,2657,8,341,220,738,4927,284,364,2465,7646,1025,220,738,3024,79,284,4927,489,38980,489,4823,10258,2657,8,489,86590,220,471,3024,79,280,633,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,79,284,3790,5122,79,2657,317,14196,19884,20,13,3146,16834,264,4823,18121,96618,4427,20797,11,1778,439,1595,2285,31981,1463,56219,7964,3493,5217,2671,369,11850,3361,5885,382,13617,320,985,1595,2285,31981,1463,56219,63,997,74694,14402,198,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,284,84266,2657,11,341,220,5911,9779,25,510,1723,4962,11,907,8,341,262,422,320,970,21326,16428,3874,341,415,471,67076,489,907,280,262,457,262,471,907,280,220,29494,3033,14196,19884,2181,596,5922,27401,430,279,1888,5603,14117,389,701,3230,1005,1162,323,8670,13,1472,1253,1390,311,2980,279,6696,65039,1990,1521,20414,304,3878,315,5178,11,23965,11,323,25780,449,2204,8403,13],"total_duration":52768868100,"load_duration":52533900,"prompt_eval_count":47,"prompt_eval_duration":654546200,"eval_count":539,"eval_duration":52061145500}

However, here are some of the most commonly cited candidates:\n\n1. Muhammad Ali: Known as \"The Greatest,\" Ali is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history. He won 56 of his 61 professional fights, including 37 knockouts, and held the heavyweight title three times.\n2. Sugar Ray Robinson: A pioneer of modern boxing, Robinson was a dominant welterweight champion who won 173 of his 179 professional fights, including 108 knockouts. He's considered by many to be the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in history.\n3. Joe Louis: Nicknamed \"The Brown Bomber,\" Louis was a formidable heavyweight champion who held the title for over 11 years and had an impressive record of 66-3 with 52 knockouts.\n4. Mike Tyson: A former undisputed heavyweight champion, Tyson is known for his intimidating presence in the ring and devastating punching power. He won 50 of his 58 professional fights, including 44 knockouts.\n5. Floyd Mayweather Jr.: A five-division world champion, Mayweather retired with a record of 50-0, including victories over some of the best boxers of his generation.\n\nOther notable contenders for the title of greatest boxer include:\n\n* Bernard Hopkins\n* Thomas Hearns\n* Lennox Lewis\n* George Foreman\n* Manny Pacquiao\n\nUltimately, determining who is the greatest boxer of all time depends on individual perspectives and criteria. Some people might prefer a more technical fighter like Sugar Ray Robinson, while others might value a dominant champion like Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson.\n\nIn 2020, ESPN conducted a poll of boxing experts and media members to determine the greatest boxer of all time. The top five winners were:\n\n1. Sugar Ray Robinson (34 votes)\n2. Muhammad Ali (26 votes)\n3. Joe Louis (18 votes)\n4. Floyd Mayweather Jr. (15 votes)\n5. Mike Tyson (13 votes)\n\nOf course, opinions on this topic will continue to vary, and the debate will likely never be settled conclusively!","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,15546,374,279,12474,79557,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,791,4320,311,420,3488,649,387,44122,11,439,18463,389,889,374,279,12474,79557,315,682,892,320,15881,835,8,8541,311,13592,11911,389,4443,12945,11,1803,1697,15837,11,323,13186,369,16865,13,4452,11,1618,527,1063,315,279,1455,17037,22628,11426,1473,16,13,36831,14925,25,49386,439,330,791,62912,1359,14925,374,13882,27458,439,832,315,279,12474,3830,388,304,3925,13,1283,2834,220,3487,315,813,220,5547,6721,28533,11,2737,220,1806,14459,11934,11,323,5762,279,71729,2316,2380,3115,627,17,13,32019,13558,28280,25,362,54047,315,6617,46329,11,28280,574,264,25462,12724,466,4870,18824,889,2834,220,11908,315,813,220,11128,6721,28533,11,2737,220,6640,14459,11934,13,1283,596,6646,555,1690,311,387,279,12474,31123,15548,48730,25902,304,3925,627,18,13,13142,12140,25,15341,31345,330,791,10690,48452,655,1359,12140,574,264,54829,71729,18824,889,5762,279,2316,369,927,220,806,1667,323,1047,459,16358,3335,315,220,2287,12,18,449,220,4103,14459,11934,627,19,13,11519,63914,25,362,4846,82037,19849,71729,18824,11,63914,374,3967,369,813,64130,9546,304,279,10264,323,33318,68981,2410,13,1283,2834,220,1135,315,813,220,2970,6721,28533,11,2737,220,2096,14459,11934,627,20,13,46899,98434,16014,18976,362,4330,12,29864,1917,18824,11,98434,22311,449,264,3335,315,220,1135,12,15,11,2737,46146,927,1063,315,279,1888,3830,388,315,813,9659,382,11663,28289,68739,369,279,2316,315,12474,79557,2997,1473,9,35352,45316,198,9,11355,57199,4511,198,9,25234,42503,21256,198,9,10058,8371,1543,198,9,95255,12925,447,23332,271,67343,11,26679,889,374,279,12474,79557,315,682,892,14117,389,3927,39555,323,13186,13,4427,1274,2643,10932,264,810,11156,25902,1093,32019,13558,28280,11,1418,3885,2643,907,264,25462,18824,1093,36831,14925,477,11519,63914,382,644,220,2366,15,11,27290,13375,264,7230,315,46329,11909,323,3772,3697,311,8417,279,12474,79557,315,682,892,13,578,1948,4330,26526,1051,1473,16,13,32019,13558,28280,320,1958,12973,340,17,13,36831,14925,320,1627,12973,340,18,13,13142,12140,320,972,12973,340,19,13,46899,98434,16014,13,320,868,12973,340,20,13,11519,63914,320,1032,12973,696,2173,3388,11,18463,389,420,8712,690,3136,311,13592,11,323,279,11249,690,4461,2646,387,23183,84082,3210,0],"total_duration":44973009900,"load_duration":476474100,"prompt_eval_count":30,"prompt_eval_duration":371027600,"eval_count":459,"eval_duration":44124829000}

However, here are some of the most popular breeds that are often considered to be among the best:\n\n1. Labrador Retriever: Known for their friendly, outgoing personalities, Labs are one of the most popular breeds in the world. They're highly intelligent, loyal, and love people.\n2. German Shepherd: Intelligent, confident, and loyal, German Shepherds are highly trainable and often work as police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and guide dogs.\n3. Golden Retriever: Similar to Labradors, Golden Retrievers are friendly, intelligent, and loyal. They're popular family pets due to their gentle nature and high trainability.\n4. French Bulldog: Playful, adaptable, and affectionate, French Bulldogs have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their laid-back nature makes them a great companion for city living.\n5. Doberman Pinscher: Intelligent, athletic, and loyal, Doberman Pinschers are often misunderstood due to their reputation. They're actually loving companions who thrive on human interaction.\n\nHowever, if we consider individual dogs rather than breeds, there are many incredible stories of remarkable canine achievements:\n\n1. Hachiko: A Japanese Akita who waited for his owner at a train station for nine years after being left behind.\n2. Rin Tin Tin: A German Shepherd who became a Hollywood star and helped to popularize the breed in the early 20th century.\n3. Laika: The first dog to orbit the Earth, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.\n4. Sgt. Stubby: An American Bulldog who served in World War I and was promoted for his heroism.\n\nUltimately, the \"greatest\" dog is a matter of personal preference and individual circumstances. Every dog has its unique qualities and characteristics that make them special and lovable.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,14965,374,279,12474,92860,221,70,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,93748,287,279,330,70,11423,1,5679,14117,389,5370,9547,1778,439,28875,11,1404,11,11478,11,32883,11,323,3927,17910,13,4452,11,1618,527,1063,315,279,1455,5526,58245,430,527,3629,6646,311,387,4315,279,1888,1473,16,13,80376,10608,462,2099,25,49386,369,872,11919,11,37798,44908,11,41740,527,832,315,279,1455,5526,58245,304,279,1917,13,2435,2351,7701,25530,11,29947,11,323,3021,1274,627,17,13,6063,59646,25,78188,11,16913,11,323,29947,11,6063,3005,29182,5469,527,7701,88761,323,3629,990,439,4379,12875,11,2778,323,17629,12875,11,323,8641,12875,627,18,13,18288,10608,462,2099,25,22196,311,11868,13584,1105,11,18288,20035,3078,527,11919,11,25530,11,323,29947,13,2435,2351,5526,3070,26159,4245,311,872,22443,7138,323,1579,5542,2968,627,19,13,8753,57754,540,25,7199,1285,11,94848,11,323,37805,349,11,8753,76564,617,3719,15098,5526,304,3293,1667,13,11205,17551,15825,7138,3727,1124,264,2294,22489,369,3363,5496,627,20,13,3234,81295,70350,9211,25,78188,11,29703,11,323,29947,11,3234,81295,70350,99723,527,3629,73956,4245,311,872,17444,13,2435,2351,3604,21955,41957,889,41972,389,3823,16628,382,11458,11,422,584,2980,3927,12875,4856,1109,58245,11,1070,527,1690,15400,7493,315,23649,76082,33997,1473,16,13,473,613,24551,25,362,11002,16762,6388,889,30315,369,813,6506,520,264,5542,8216,369,11888,1667,1306,1694,2163,4920,627,17,13,58468,57355,57355,25,362,6063,59646,889,6244,264,17681,6917,323,9087,311,5526,553,279,28875,304,279,4216,220,508,339,9478,627,18,13,5034,11755,25,578,1176,5679,311,27605,279,9420,11,11887,555,279,19953,9323,304,220,6280,22,627,19,13,56760,13,800,55954,25,1556,3778,57754,540,889,10434,304,4435,5111,358,323,574,30026,369,813,12084,2191,382,67343,11,279,330,70,11423,1,5679,374,264,5030,315,4443,22698,323,3927,13463,13,7357,5679,706,1202,5016,29600,323,17910,430,1304,1124,3361,323,781,24694,13],"total_duration":40738221600,"load_duration":53366500,"prompt_eval_count":32,"prompt_eval_duration":303022300,"eval_count":393,"eval_duration":40380832600}
