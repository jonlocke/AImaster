That seems like a pretty basic time query but with an unusual capitalization that might indicate either urgency or just casual emphasis.\n\nOkay, first things first - they probably want to know the current local time rather than any specific timezone since they didn't specify one. The lack of details suggests this is for immediate use, maybe checking schedules or appointments.\n\nI should respond in a friendly but direct manner matching their tone slightly while keeping it professional. The all-caps might be shouting, so I'll acknowledge that with capitalization in my response too to mirror their style without being overly intense.\n\nThe user didn't provide location information though... If they wanted precise time they'd have specified timezone or city earlier.

{"model":"LLAMA3.2","created_at":"2025-08-01T10:01:41.9794419Z","response":"When handling special characters in a JSON response to a REST API, there are several approaches you can take:\n\n1. **URL Encoding**: You can URL encode the special characters using the `encodeURIComponent()` function in JavaScript or by adding `%` followed by the hexadecimal representation of each character.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst specialChar = '!@#$%^\u0026*()';\nconst encodedChar = encodeURIComponent(specialChar);\n```\n\n2. **JSON.stringify with replacer**: You can use the `JSON.stringify()` method with a custom replacer function that replaces special characters with their escaped versions.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nfunction replaceSpecialChars(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj, (key, value) =\u003e {\n    if (value.includes('%')) {\n      value = '%' + value;\n    }\n    return value;\n  });\n}\n\nconst data = { name: 'John Doe', message: '!@#$%^\u0026*()' };\nconst json = replaceSpecialChars(data);\n```\n\n3. **Using a library or framework**: Some libraries and frameworks, such as React or Angular, provide built-in methods for handling special characters in JSON responses.\n\nExample (React):\n```javascript\nimport { stringify } from 'react-query';\n\n// ...\n\nconst response = {\n  status: 200,\n  data: {\n    name: 'John Doe',\n    message: '!@#$%^\u0026*()'\n  }\n};\n\nconst json = stringify(response);\n```\n\n4. **JSONP (JSON with Padding)**: If the client is making a request to a different origin, you can use JSONP to handle special characters.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nfunction handleJsonp(data) {\n  const callback = 'myCallback';\n  const jsonp = callback + '(' + JSON.stringify(data) + ')';\n  return jsonp;\n}\n\nconst data = { name: 'John Doe', message: '!@#$%^\u0026*()' };\nconst jsonp = handleJsonp(data);\n```\n\n5. **Using a JSON processor**: Some libraries, such as `json-stringify-safe`, provide additional options for handling special characters.\n\nExample (using `json-stringify-safe`):\n```javascript\nconst data = { name: 'John Doe', message: '!@#$%^\u0026*()' };\nconst json = stringify(data, {\n  replacer: [function(key, value) {\n    if (value.includes('%')) {\n      return '%' + value;\n    }\n    return value;\n  }]\n});\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that the best approach depends on your specific use case and requirements. You may want to consider the trade-offs between these approaches in terms of performance, complexity, and compatibility with different clients.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,473,221,221,221,221,61297,20076,23893,6969,17485,7354,53569,13953,2006,362,4823,3680,25874,5257,362,26487,77273,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,4599,11850,3361,5885,304,264,4823,2077,311,264,26487,5446,11,1070,527,3892,20414,499,649,1935,1473,16,13,3146,3222,30430,96618,1472,649,5665,16559,279,3361,5885,1701,279,1595,98783,55358,734,304,13210,477,555,7999,62500,63,8272,555,279,70822,13340,315,1855,3752,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1040,3361,4873,284,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,368,1025,1040,21136,4873,284,57837,1161,3037,4873,317,14196,19884,17,13,3146,5483,10258,449,5911,9779,96618,1472,649,1005,279,1595,5483,10258,55358,1749,449,264,2587,5911,9779,734,430,41800,3361,5885,449,872,28883,11028,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1723,8454,20989,33616,6922,8,341,220,471,4823,10258,6922,11,320,798,11,907,8,591,341,262,422,320,970,21326,16428,3874,341,415,907,284,67076,489,907,280,262,457,262,471,907,280,220,1657,633,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,284,8454,20989,33616,2657,317,14196,19884,18,13,3146,16834,264,6875,477,12914,96618,4427,20797,323,49125,11,1778,439,3676,477,29678,11,3493,5918,3502,5528,369,11850,3361,5885,304,4823,14847,382,13617,320,15143,997,74694,14402,198,475,314,84266,335,505,364,3007,66589,2412,322,5585,1040,2077,284,341,220,2704,25,220,1049,345,220,828,25,341,262,836,25,364,13379,50728,756,262,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,368,1270,220,457,2368,1040,3024,284,84266,5802,317,14196,19884,19,13,3146,5483,47,320,5483,449,23889,33395,25,1442,279,3016,374,3339,264,1715,311,264,2204,6371,11,499,649,1005,4823,47,311,3790,3361,5885,382,13617,512,74694,14402,198,1723,3790,5122,79,2657,8,341,220,738,4927,284,364,2465,7646,1025,220,738,3024,79,284,4927,489,38980,489,4823,10258,2657,8,489,86590,220,471,3024,79,280,633,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,79,284,3790,5122,79,2657,317,14196,19884,20,13,3146,16834,264,4823,18121,96618,4427,20797,11,1778,439,1595,2285,31981,1463,56219,7964,3493,5217,2671,369,11850,3361,5885,382,13617,320,985,1595,2285,31981,1463,56219,63,997,74694,14402,198,1040,828,284,314,836,25,364,13379,50728,518,1984,25,63026,31,49177,46999,5,9,80355,2670,1040,3024,284,84266,2657,11,341,220,5911,9779,25,510,1723,4962,11,907,8,341,262,422,320,970,21326,16428,3874,341,415,471,67076,489,907,280,262,457,262,471,907,280,220,29494,3033,14196,19884,2181,596,5922,27401,430,279,1888,5603,14117,389,701,3230,1005,1162,323,8670,13,1472,1253,1390,311,2980,279,6696,65039,1990,1521,20414,304,3878,315,5178,11,23965,11,323,25780,449,2204,8403,13],"total_duration":52768868100,"load_duration":52533900,"prompt_eval_count":47,"prompt_eval_duration":654546200,"eval_count":539,"eval_duration":52061145500}

When diving, or stooping, they can reach speeds of up to 389 km/h (242 mph), making them not only the fastest bird but also one of the fastest animals on record.\n\nDuring level flight, peregrine falcons can reach speeds of around 50-60 km/h (31-37 mph), which is relatively fast for a bird. However, when diving down to catch prey or escape predators, they can accelerate to incredible velocities, making them one of the most formidable and efficient hunters in the avian world.\n\nOther birds that are known for their impressive speed include:\n\n* Golden Eagle: up to 320 km/h (200 mph) during level flight\n* Gyrfalcon: up to 290 km/h (180 mph)\n* Kestrel: up to 240 km/h (150 mph)\n\nKeep in mind that these speeds can vary depending on the species, altitude, and other environmental factors.
